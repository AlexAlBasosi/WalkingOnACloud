# Walking on a Cloud

This workshop is intended to provide an introduction to cloud-based programming with IBM Cloud. It provides step-by-step instructions for setting up an IBM Cloud account with a simple Cloudant® database, creating a basic web app in JavaScript, and utilizing Watson™ APIs.

## Web App Activity List

This repository consists of lab exercises that will show you how to create a web application that runs on an IBM Cloud server. The application consists of a node.js server that accesses a Cloudant® database and uses the IBM Watson™ Language Translator service. Each lab exercise will introduce new concepts that will progressively build up to a fully functional web application. These are some of the techniques we used to build our app: [thinkinfinity.mybluemix.net/](thinkinfinity.mybluemix.net/). The source code for the web application can be found at: [github.com/danacv2/ThinkInfinity](github.com/danacv2/ThinkInfinity).

1.	Hello World – This exercise will start off with setting up IBM Cloud to run your application. The application will be a simple web page that contains the text Hello World.
2.	Cloudant Introduction – This exercise adds a Cloudant database to your application and explains how to setup and retrieve information from it.
3.	Create Database Entries – This exercise will expand what was discussed in the previous section and go into more details of how to input data into your database.
4.	GUI Introduction – This exercise discusses how to add graphical elements to your web application.
5.	Watson Language Translator Introduction – This exercise adds a Watson Language Translator to your application and explains how to use the service to translate text.

## Hello World

In this section we will go over creating a node.js project in IBM Cloud and the basic setup. We will create a simple hello world application that will run on a node.js server with a simple webpage.

1.	Login to IBM Cloud or create an account.
2.	From the main page click on Catalog in the upper right hand side.
